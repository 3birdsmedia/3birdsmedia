  Long time friend and client Daphne Valerious needed a portfolio website for her production reel and other functions. After stablishing that she wanted a one page layout, looking at some inspirations sites, and some quick mockups, this is the layout we agreed on.
</p>
<p>
  One of the main challenges for this site was keeping the user in the same page, to achieve this all galleries and videos are loaded with either lightbox (for galleries) or bPopUp (for any other content).
</p>
<p>
  The color scheme comes from Daphne's logo, also we chose a dark background on certain sections to make the imagery stand out more and give the site contrast.
