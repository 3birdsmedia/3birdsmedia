<p>Sur Technologies inc, was an independent supplier and manufacturer of value added subsystems (Memory) to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

<p>One of the highlights of this site is the capability to look-up provided parts. The MySQL database for this website has a many to many relationship, therefore it was challenging to optimize the queries to be fast and reliable, after putting the logic down on paper I was able to get the queries to behave as intended.

<p>
  I also provided Graphic Design and Print services for Surtech, together with business cards and even some powerpoint presentations.
