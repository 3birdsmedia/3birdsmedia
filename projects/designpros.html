  Design Pros, Inc is where I got my first office job as a designer, once my boss found out that I could code he immmediatedly set me to the task of redoing the company's website.
</p>
<p>
  I was responsible for most of the design with some really good critism from my boss, an amazing print designer. This also played a part into the challenge of this site, translating print design to the web world. I accomplished this by keeping the design as simple as posible so that the print portfolio pieces would really stand out, I also took part in product shoot for the portfolio gallery.
</p>
<p>
  The color scheme comes from DP's logo; black and red are very over powering colors so I had to limit my use of them and replace it with platinum and white.
