  This new and upcoming author was in need of a website to advertize herself and new book, I also came up with her logo and branding and set her up with a few MailChimp templates to get her going.
</p>
<p>
  One of the things that I kept in mind was expansion of the site, as she is already working on her second book being published, she will be able to use the middle section as a slide/carousel of her books. Also her header image can be changed seasonaly to feature upcoming releases.

  The color scheme for this site is meant to reflect a "classy beach", Jennifer is a surfer girl from Laguna Beach and having that come throught the site was really important. </p>
