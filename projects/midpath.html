  The midpath is a series of pages that show up after a user clicks on a registration link given by the clients ad service.
</p>
<p>
  The main task for this site was to keep internal CSS and specific styles to a minimun, these pages all pull css from one file, which could get fairly large if cluttered with to many dedicated styles. In the back end (unfurtunatedly I was not a part of that branch) the users can select these pages as templates to create diferent campains for different demographics, so they needed to be as generic as posible without being boring.

  The design inspiration for these came from years of surfing the web and having ads pop out :) I took it personally to make this ad containers something awesome to look at!
