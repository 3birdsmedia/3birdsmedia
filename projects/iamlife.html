<p>At iAmLife I was part of a small team of very talented developers, my main function at the start was to provide endpoints and implement APIs required by the Front-End Development team to integrate with 3rd parties such as Reddit, Twitter, Linkedin and Stripe.
</p><p>After a few months, I stepped in as the UX/UI designer for graphics and also provided the company with "How to ..." videos. I became support for the Front-End development team with troubleshooting and design implementation on the website and mobile app, this was done one a  Drupal 8/Vue.js/Quasar stack.</p>
