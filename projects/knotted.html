 This is one of my first sites after I graduated, the client really like the idea of a one page layout done diferent, so we agreed that a horizontal scroll would give her the uniqueness she wanted still keeping the site user friendly.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most entertaining parts of this site was creating the artwork, Knotted Ribbon really wanted the site to be palpable, so I added element from the real world and used them to embelish the site as much as possible without compromising load time.</p>
<p>
  For this client I also created the logo and branding, the logo of course is composed of a ribbon with a small knot in it, and their branded color is royal purple to give her clients a first impression of quality.
