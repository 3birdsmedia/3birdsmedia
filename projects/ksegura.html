  When discussing with the client what the purpose of this site was, we agreed that it was more to be informational than showcasy. The client already has a blog where she populates all of her pictures within an article. 
</p>
<p>
  One of the main challenges for this site was to design something simple that didnt look like every other photography website, to do so we came up with branding that was vibrant, the dark grey background lets the images stand out more.
</p>
<p>
  The color scheme comes from Kirstie's logo, which was also part of the project.
