      "description" : "<p>At iAmLife I was part of a small team of very talented developers, my main function at the start was to provide endpoints and implement APIs required by the Front-End Development team to integrate with 3rd parties such as Reddit, Twitter, Linkedin and Stripe.</p><p>After a few months, I stepped in as the UX/UI designer to transition the app into a light theme and produced mockups when new feauteres were added. I also produced the company's \"How to ...\" videos and became support for the Front-End development team with troubleshooting and design implementation on the website and mobile app, this was done one a  Drupal 8/Vue.js/Quasar stack.</p>",

      "description" : "<p>Developing the branding for Apokaradokia, LLC has been one of the most well rounded projects I have been a part of. It encompassed a full branding package for 7 companies, everything from logo and stationary to digital presence</p><p>Part of the challenge was to interprete some of the less literal logos into something cohesive and that still felt like part of the family of companies (i.e. Kovenant, a clothing line, sharing space with Arrow of Victory an LLC regitrar). The solution was to use arrows as an element to tie all the logos together, they also use a two tone approach in which each logo shares a color with at least one other logo of the family.</p>",

This lead to the site being fairly simple and to the point: Who we are and what we do.</p></p>Not having contact information on the site was an intentional decision by the client, as they wanted to keep their clientel exclusive to referrals.</p>",
