I became support for the Front-End development team with troubleshooting and design implementation on the website and mobile app, this was done one a  Drupal 8/Vue.js/Quasar stack.</p>",

It encompassed a full branding package for 7 companies, everything from logo and stationary to digital presence</p><p>Part of the challenge was to interprete some of the less literal logos into something cohesive and that still felt like part of the family of companies (i.e. Kovenant, a clothing line, sharing space with Arrow of Victory an LLC regitrar). The solution was to use arrows as an element to tie all the logos together, they also all share a two tone approach in which each logo shares a color with at least one other logo of the family.</p>",
