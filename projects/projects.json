One of my most challenging sites yet, due to the many layers of complexity that these products carried with them. From ordering single sheets, to ordering pre-printed bulk, all this functionalities are included in the cart.</p><p>Another nice detail on this site is that it has a fully integrated CMS, this way the user could upload, edit, delete all their products. It also had an order tracking system.</p>",

After stablishing that she wanted a one page layout, looking at some inspirations sites, and some quick mockups, this is the layout we agreed on.</p><p>One of the main challenges for this site was keeping the user in the same page, to achieve this all galleries and videos are loaded with either lightbox (for galleries) or bPopUp (for any other content).</p><p>The color scheme comes from Daphne's logo, also we chose a dark background on certain sections to make the imagery stand out more and give the site contrast.</p>",
