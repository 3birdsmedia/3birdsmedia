	   <h2>Helping Hand</h2>
	   
	   <p>Welcome to the CJT Helping Hand support system. Your mounting support team is ready to help guide you through your mounting challenges. CJT understands mounting can be a challenging task, for many reasons. We also understand the important role the mounting system plays in achieving successful communication, which is why CJT created the CJT Helping Hand support system: to ensure our customers get the help they need when they need it.</p>
	   
<p>Getting started is easy. Simply download the CJT Helping Hand packet. In the packet, you will find the Helping Hand Steps, the Photo Tip Sheet and the Initial Information Worksheet. </p>

<p>The Helping Hand Steps is an overview of how your request is processed.  The Photo Tip Sheet is a brief instruction sheet on how to take pictures that present the most helpful information for evaluating a wheelchair for a mounting system.  The Initial Information Worksheet is a pdf. template that can be filled out on your computer.  The worksheet has specific questions about the wheelchair on to which the mount will go, which allows us to help you determine your best mounting option.</p>

<p>We recommend that you save the Initial Information Worksheet to your computer to fill out. Once you have completed the worksheet and have taken your photos, save the template with the information using a file name that references your client.  Once your file is saved you have the option to either upload your file on our secure website or email your file to <a href="mailto:quoterequest@yescjt.com" >quoterequest@yescjt.com</a></p>

<p>If you decide to email your file, please note that most email services will not allow attachments greater than 26 megabytes. Depending on the size of your photos, you may need to send multiple emails.</p>
<p>Please see instructions for uploading your file on the image upload page.</p>
