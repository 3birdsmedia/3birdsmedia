                <p>Hello, my name is Marco Segura, and you are visiting THE RIDE website, if you are wondering what THE RIDE is, it's actually kind of simple, THE RIDE is a fundraiser for an the upcoming mission trips at Cornerstone Christian Fellowship. It will consist on a ride from the sunny beaches of Huntington to the also sunny beaches of San Diego. This 100 mile (aproximatedly) ride, will take ME and a group of riders through Oceanside, Camp Penalton, Mission Viejo, Laguna Beach, Dana Point and such.</p>
                
                <h2>What does this have to do with YOU?</h2>
                <p>Well, if you are on this site is for one of 3 reasons:
                	<ol>
                    	<li> You are a relative, friend, family friend, of one of the riders and we told you to check it out.</li>
                        <li> You don't know us, but somehow you heard about it.</li>
                        <li> Or... you were googling: Bikes, Rides, Missions, Ireland, Panama, or Marco Segura (which would be kind of weird)</li>
                    </ol>
